## About The Project

The LinkTree Clone is a simple web application that allows users to create a single link that leads to a landing page containing multiple links to their social media profiles, websites, and other online content. This web application is a clone of the popular website LinkTree, which provides a similar service for individuals and businesses looking to consolidate their online presence in a single place.

With the LinkTree Clone, users can create a customized landing page with their own branding and color scheme, and add links to their various online profiles and content. The landing page is designed to be mobile-friendly and easily shareable on social media platforms, making it a convenient and efficient way to promote one's online presence.

This version of the LinkTree Clone was created using only HTML and CSS, demonstrating the ability to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing web application using just these two languages. With its clean and modern design, the LinkTree Clone is a great example of the power of HTML and CSS in creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.
